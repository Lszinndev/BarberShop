# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open the local URL printed by the dev server (e.g. http://localhost:3000). By default Create React App
will try port 3000; if it's busy it will use the next available port (e.g. 3001, 3002).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Backend API configuration

The frontend can call the backend API in two ways during development:

- Using the CRA proxy (recommended for local development): `package.json` contains a `proxy` field
	that forwards relative requests (like `/api/clients`) to the backend (example `http://localhost:5105`).
	To use this, do not set `REACT_APP_API_URL` â€” keep the default relative URLs in the code.

- Pointing directly to the backend by setting an environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` (useful for
	production builds or when you want to bypass the proxy). Set this in a `.env` file at the project root
	(see `.env.example`). Example:

	REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5105

When `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set, the app will call that base URL directly. When it's empty/unset, the
app uses relative paths and the CRA dev server proxy will forward requests to the URL configured in
`package.json`.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
